| **What happened from your perspective?** | **What might they think happened (their perspective)?** | **Situation - Describe the feedback that you need to give objectively** |
|-------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| My colleague fails to deliver their designated deliverable within specified milestone fulfilment period. He is lazy and doesn't prioritize the collaborative project. | A power outage in my residence area compromised my ability to work because my laptop doesn't have a long battery life. | On [specific date], you missed the deadline for delivering your assigned project milestone, which was due as part of our collaborative project timeline. |

| **What do you feel (your identity) being judged / attacked?** | **How they might feel their identity is being questioned / judged?** | **Behaviour - What's the objective observed behaviour?** |
|--------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| I feel frustrated and let down because I rely on timely contributions to meet our project goals, and I worry this reflects poorly on the team. | They might feel their work ethic or reliability is being questioned, or that they're being unfairly labeled as lazy without understanding their circumstances. | You did not submit the deliverable by the agreed-upon deadline and did not communicate any challenges or delays in advance. |

| **How do you feel (your identity) being judged / attacked?** | **How they might feel their identity is being questioned / judged?** | **Impact - What's the impact of their behaviour on you?** |
|--------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| I feel stressed and overburdened because I had to adjust my own workload to compensate for the delay, which impacted my ability to meet other deadlines. | They might feel embarrassed or defensive, thinking their personal challenges are being ignored, or that they're seen as unprofessional. | The delay caused a ripple effect, increasing my workload, creating stress, and risking the overall project timeline for the team. |

| **Action plan - co-create the solution:** |
|------------------------------------------|
| Let's discuss any challenges you're facing and set up a plan to ensure timely communication in the future. We can establish check-ins before deadlines and explore solutions like backup power options or alternative workspaces to prevent similar issues. Additionally, if delays are unavoidable, please notify the team as early as possible so we can adjust accordingly. |
